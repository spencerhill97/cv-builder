# CV Builder

This CV Builder project is meant to showcase the user's work experience, education, contact information, and showcase a portrait of the user. This project was inspired by The Odin Project's React curriculum and was not too difficult to build, but working with class Components was almost completely new to me. There was a brief period where prop drilling and building my components did not seem as intuitive. I enjoyed this project and I want to add more features to make the web app more polished, so I can use it myself!
